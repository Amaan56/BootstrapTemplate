Blockchain
Wikipedia Defination

Block has:
Data
Own Hash( Data +  Prev Hash)
Prev Hash
Block Number
Nonce

Genesis Block = First Block


SHA 256 =  One way
Avalenche Affect

Immutable Ledger

Distributed Network P2P
Consensus Protocol - Overwrite
51 Attack -  attack at the same time then they take over the network

Mining
There is a target, hash value should be below the target : Just to give hurdle for mining
Miners create blocks
Miners can only change nonce

Consensus Prototcal
PoW
PoS
